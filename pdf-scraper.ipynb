Internet research\\nfrom Europe on young people without disabilities using the internet\\nimplies a shift taking place from the mere use of the internet in\\neveryday life to adolescents living their everyday life online, mediatedby the internet (Livingstone et al., 2018 ). However, the extent of\\nmaking use of the internet and how it transfers into and mediates\\neveryday life for young people with learning disabilities has not beenexamined according to a recent literature review by Glencross et al.(2021 ). Their review indicates that studies most often show use of\\nthe internet for social networking and entertainment and focus on\\nthe risks with internet use, rather than the benefits for people withlearning disabilities (Glencross et al., 2021 ). Research comparing\\ninternet use of adolescents with learning disabilities with a reference\\ngroup of adolescents without, show a digital lag in having access todigital devices, using the internet and performing internet activities\\n(Alfredsson Ågren et al., 2020a ). It was found that 70% –80% of\\nyoung people with learning disabilities perform internet activities forentertainment purposes, while 50% use social media, compared withclose to all in a reference group, and 20% were searching online for\\ninformation compared with 84% among young people without\\nlearning disabilities (Alfredsson Ågren et al., 2020a ). Further, this\\ndigital divide can be identified as inequalities in access to and use of\\nthe internet and reinforce inequalities in society (Scheerder et al.,\\n2017 ). Therefore, research on digital divide has been called for\\nfocusing on different groups in society, for example, people with\\nlearning disabilities, that traditionally experience exclusion in many\\nareas of everyday life and being participatory citizens.\\nNevertheless, the increased use of mobile technology among\\npeople with learning disabilities may provide opportunities to develop\\nsocial relations and contribute to a sense of belonging in thecommunity (Danker et al., 2022 ; Darcy et al., 2016 ; Kim & Qian,\\n2022). Social media use has recently been shown to contribute to\\naccess to societal information for example keeping up to date on\\nworld events among young adults with learning disabilities (Kim &Qian, 2022). A review article specifically on social media use among\\nyoung people with learning disabilities (Caton & Chapman, 2016 )\\nrevealed positive experiences from using social media, as well aschallenges. Examples of positive experiences were using social media\\nto keep friends, and for the development of social identity, whilechallenges with online codes and net etiquette was also experienced\\n(Caton & Chapman, 2016 ). Similar challenges of understanding social\\nonline codes have been reported by parents of young people with\\nlearning disabilities, together with challenges with technical andcognitive abilities for online participation (Sorbring et al., 2017 ).\\nFurther challenges that have been identified for people with learning\\ndisabilities are a lack of access to digital devices and internetconnection in some settings, such as group homes (Alfredsson Ågren\\net al., 2020b ; Danker et al., 2022 ) or challenges with handling the\\nrapidly changing digital environment (Alfredsson Ågren et al., 2020b ).\\nTo enable the digital participation of people with learning disabilities,Lussier ‐Desrochers et al. ( 2017 ) summarized five dimensions or\\nrequirements and address the above ‐found challenges. They are:\\naccess to devices and the internet; technical skills; sensorimotorskills; cognitive skills and an understanding of social online codes and\\nconventions. Together these environmental and personal factors\\ninfluence digital participation as challenges or opportunities (Lussier ‐\\nDesrochers et al., 2017 ).\\nAlthough, there needs to be an awareness of the challenges and\\nthe risks with internet use and how to provide support for risk ‐taking\\non the internet (Borgström, 2021 ; Danker et al., 2022 ) recent studies\\nhave signalled the internet to be a less vulnerable place for people\\nwith learning disabilities than earlier anticipated. People with learning\\ndisabilities are motivated to use the internet and have someawareness of the online risks themselves (Alfredsson Ågren et al.,\\n2020a ; Chadwick, 2022 ). It has been highlighted that research on\\ninternet use and people with learning disabilities have been missing\\nout on the possibilities that may come with using the internet, and\\nthere is a need of empirical research of internet usage and how online\\nuse is being translated into offline lives for the target group(Glencross et al., 2021 ). This has also been highlighted in research\\nincluding parents who have identified online use as an opportunity\\nfor social participation and participation in society (Sorbring et al.,2017 ). This poses the question of how online use and reported digital\\nlag influence the internet outcomes of social participation and\\ncommunity participation for young people with learning disabilities.\\nInternet outcomes are described by Scheerder et al. ( 2017 )a s\\ndifferent beneficial outcomes from internet use that adds on to digital\\naccess, skills, and use and should be studied in upcoming research as\\na determinant of digital divides.\\nThis calls for knowledge of how internet use influences\\noutcomes on aspects of participation for young people with learning126 |\\nÅGREN ET AL.\\n 14683156, 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bld.12519 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [21/07/2023].

       " \"disabilities from their own perspectives, as they are entering the\\nunavoidable online use in everyday life. Definitions of participationhave not yet reached a consensus among researchers, professionals,\\nor people with disabilities, but participation has been deemed critical\\nfor health and well ‐being (Chang & Coster, 2014 ). In a conceptual\\nmodel of participation by Chang and Coster ( 2014 ) aspects of\\neveryday life are important in conceptualizing participation together\\nwith the need to categorize participation by either type or setting.The identified types of participation are three: productivity, social,and community, and the purpose of the activities within them define\\nthe type of participation rather than the settings in which they take\\nplace. In the current study, the focus is on types of social andcommunity participation including roles as family members and friend\\nin social participation and being a citizen and consumer of leisure\\ntime in the community as proposed by Chang and Coster ( 2014 ). Full\\nand effective participation in society on equal terms as others are\\noutspoken rights in the Swedish Act (SFS, 1993 : 387) and the UN\\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN, 2006 ). It\\ninvolves being given the possibility to interact with others and\\nperform activities as a participatory citizen, for example taking part in\\nleisure activities in the community with others or taking part in thelabour market (Chang & Coster, 2014 ). Further, it entails keeping\\nupdated on societal online information, to participate in society\\ntoday, as most information is digital (Statista, 2022 ). As participation\\ncannot be extracted from settings (Chang & Coster, 2014 ) with their\\ndifferent demands, environmental opportunities and challenges are\\ncrucial to explore with internet ‐using young people with both mild\\nand moderate learning disabilities who perform internet activities toexplore the internet outcomes on social participation and community\\nparticipation in the digital society.\\n2|AIM\\nThis study aims to explore environmental opportunities and\\nchallenges when performing internet activities and how internet\\nuse influences social and community participation for young people\\nwith learning disabilities from the perspectives of the target group.\\n3|METHODS\\nThis study applied an inductive design, with focused observations and\\nfollow ‐up interviews of internet ‐using young people with learning\\ndisabilities in their everyday settings.\\n3.1 |Participants\\nParticipants were recruited from six municipalities in Sweden, from\\nspecial schools and work settings of daily activity services throughpurposeful sampling (Patton, 2015 ). Inclusion criteria were young\\npeople with mild or moderate learning disabilities, between 13 and 25years old, and identified by staff at the special school or activity\\nservice as being internet users. In total 11 special schools and 6activity services were approached but four special schools and two\\nactivity services declined to participate in the study due to a heavy\\nworkload and difficulties identifying young people who were internetusers or willing to participate.\\nParticipants are in total 15: 4 men and 11 women, between the\\nages of 13 and 24 years ( m= 18.5) with mild ( n= 6) and moderate\\n(n= 9) learning disabilities. The severity of disability was verified by\\nthe type of school the participants were enrolled in or stated by\\nhealth professional staff at the activity services. Two ‐thirds of\\nparticipants were in special school ( n= 10) and one ‐third worked at\\nactivity services ( n= 5), and most participants lived in their parental\\nhome, and two lived in accommodated group homes.\\n3.2 |Procedure and data collection\\nContact persons from seven special schools and four activity services\\nidentified participants based on the inclusion criteria and organized\\nthe first meeting between participant and researcher to establishrapport (Taylor et al., 2016 ). An initial pre ‐fieldwork visit was\\nconducted with nine of the participants. For the remaining six\\nparticipants the consent forms were sent to the first author from the\\ncontact person.\\nThe focus of the data collection was on the internet devices\\nincluding apps and the internet activities the participants performed\\nin their everyday life, and the settings they performed them in. Datawere collected through participant observations in two ‐three every-\\nday settings per participant being at school or activity services and at\\nhome. A follow ‐up interview was done with each participant at the\\nlast observation. To get access to the target groups perspectivecognitive adaptations were made to enable the participant's view.\\nPhotographs were taken during the observations and used as picture ‐\\nbased support during the follow ‐up interviews (Folkestad &\\nFolkestad, 2000 ). Further, the questions asked during observations\\nand the follow ‐up interviews were formulated with easier wordings\\nor in either ‐or format (Taylor et al., 2016 ). All data collection was\\nperformed by the first author.\\n3.2.1 |Observations\\nParticipants were observed between 1 and 6 hours per participant, in\\ntotal 71 hours over 32 occasions, which included the follow upinterview. The initial observations took place in the participants'\\nschool or activity service setting. The second observations were\\nconducted either at the participants' home ( n= 8) or on a second\\noccasion in free time at school or the activity service at a suitable\\ntime for participants and within 2 weeks following the first\\nobservation. During the observations, the participant was followedin his or her ongoing events in the setting, for example, during\\nteacher ‐led lessons at school or when being with friends during breakÅGREN ET AL.\\n |127\\n 14683156, 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bld.12519 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [21/07/2023].

( 2016 ) about\\ntheir internet use in the settings from questions such as: Can you\\nshow me more of what you do [on the Internet] here? Why do you do it?\\nDuring observations, field notes of the participants performing\\ninternet activities in the different contexts were handwritten in a\\nfield notebook, alongside the observer's reflections (Taylor et al.,\\n2016 ). The observation occasions were audio recorded and photo-\\ngraphs were taken of the digital devices showing the screens whenused by the participants, resulting in a total of 269 photographs,\\nm= 18 per participant. The photographs were used as memory ‐aids\\nand picture ‐based support during follow ‐up interviews and when\\ntranscribing the field notes. The first author made transcriptions of\\nthe audio recordings and fieldnotes, close in time to the actual\\nobservation.\\n3.2.2 |Follow ‐up interviews\\nDuring the follow ‐up interviews mainly three recurrent questions\\nwere asked about the observed performance of internet activities:How come you do it? Whom do you do it with? and, Why do you do it?\\nThe photos from the observations were printed or shown on the\\nresearcher's tablet to the participant as a cognitive adaptation during\\nfollow ‐up interviews (Folkestad & Folkestad, 2000 ). Further, partici-\\npants used their own digital devices to show and clarify their answers\\nand performed internet activities. Probing questions were formulated\\nwith easier wordings or in either ‐or format (Taylor et al., 2016 ) and\\nwere used alongside the three recurrent questions, for example:\\nWhat did you do here? [asked at the same time as looking at a photo],\\nWhat do you have here? [on the starting screen) Why do you have thatthere? Is it because X or Y? The follow ‐up interviews were audio ‐\\nrecorded and transcribed as part of the transcribed observations.\\n3.3 |Data analysis\\nThe transcribed observational field notes with conversations and the\\nfollow ‐up interviews were analysed interpretatively using open\\ncoding in line with Taylor et al. ( 2016 ) and inductive analysis as\\nproposed by Patton ( 2015 ). Initially, all the transcriptions were read\\nthrough to get an overall understanding of the material. Subsequently\\nin the analysis process, the transcribed material was read and re ‐read,\\nstarting with one participant at a time in all his/her settings to identifythemes to answer the aim. Data from the specific cases ofparticipants were analysed inductively for patterns, and writings\\nwere done in the margins to keep track of interpretations of the\\nmaterial (Patton, 2015 ). General patterns occurred from the case ‐\\nspecific analysis, for example, using online communication tools to\\ninteract with others as a way of socially participating. These findings\\nwere preliminarily organized and labelled in the ongoing discoveryapproach (Taylor et al., 2016 ) and themes were identified within\\nopportunities and challenges in the environment and social andcommunity participation. Thirdly, cases were compared in a cross ‐\\ncase analysis (Patton, 2015 ). This was done from the settings,\\nanalysing all cases from the school ‐setting, followed by the work\\nsetting, and finally, all cases at home and in free time, which\\ngenerated further themes. They were marked with different coloursand put together with drafts from the transcriptions to get an\\noverview. In total the analysis process generated eight themes. Two\\nwere concluded from the environmental opportunities and chal-lenges, being Access to and design of digital devices and Support, digital\\ncompetence, and rules . Further, three themes of internet use and\\nsocial participation were found: Maintain and establish social contacts;\\nBelonging to social groups , and Restrictions in social participation and\\nsocial codes , and finally three themes were found of internet use and\\ncommunity participation: Searching, finding and understanding infor-\\nmation in society; Using internet to take part in leisure activities in thecommunity and Internet use and restrictions in community participation .\\nThe themes were validated using quotes from the transcriptions,\\nwhere the first author is referred to as Observer in the result section.\\n3.4 |Ethical consideration\\nThe Regional Ethics Board of Linköping, Sweden approved the study\\n(141201; Dnr: 2014/370 ‐31). Ethical considerations on providing\\ninformation to enable young people with learning disabilities to giveinformed consent to participate were specifically addressed, and\\ninformation of the study was written in easy ‐read text supported\\nwith pictures (Folkestad & Folkestad, 2000 ). An initial pre ‐fieldwork\\nvisit was set up and conducted with nine of the participants in their\\nschool or work setting, as a possibility to meet before following them\\nin their everyday settings. On this occasion, the field notebook wasshown, and we tried the Dictaphone out. Additional verbal informa-tion was provided to ensure informed consent on the first meeting\\nwith the participant. The observations were open to everyone in the\\nsettings and for the second occasion at home or in free time, theparents were contacted for some participants who suggested it when\\nasked. All data collection was performed by the first author, who\\nneeded to be flexible and respect integrity for all in the settingsduring observations. To secure anonymity all names in the study are\\npseudonyms.\\n4|FINDINGS\\n4.1 |Environmental opportunities and challenges\\nwhen performing internet activities\\n4.1.1 |Access to and design of digital devices\\nAll participants had access to more than one digital device which\\nprovided an opportunity for performing internet activities. The digitaldevices most often used by participants were devices with touch\\nscreens with apps, mostly smartphones, and tablets. Few participants128 |\\nÅGREN ET AL.\\n 14683156, 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bld.12519 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [21/07/2023].

       " 'had laptops with adaptations, but among those who had, the laptop\\nwas their most used digital device.\\nA challenge for some participants was to sensorimotor handle\\nthe small ‐sized digital devices, such as smartphones that often have\\nsmall screens. For example, Cecilia had impaired vision and had tohold her smartphone very close to her eyes to see what was on the\\nscreen. Another challenge in the environment for some was not being\\nable to open and use apps they had downloaded. These were appsthat involved using a second app to finish off the activity, forexample, when e ‐shopping or apps for buying bus tickets. The\\nchallenges were remembering passwords or to proceed inside the\\napp due to difficulties following instructions in several steps. Thisreveals a need to focus on the need to design digital devices and apps\\nto obtain optimal digital conditions to perform internet activities for\\nthe target group.\\n4.1.2 |Support, digital competence, and rules\\nPersons providing digital support served as opportunities in the\\nimmediate social environment for performing internet activities.These persons included staff and peers at schools or activityservices and parents and siblings at home. Participants often\\npreferred the support of someone of the same age as themselves\\nand most often asked peers, siblings, or younger relatives forsupport. For example, Tina calls out to one of her peers at the\\nactivity service:\\nYou, you help me. You have latest iPhone! You know\\nmore. Not him [nodding towards a staff member and\\ngiggles]. Her peer replies: “Yeah, yeah …I think I do\\nactually .\\nThis shows that preferably young people with digital competence\\nwere chosen by the participants for digital support and could be apeer with learning disabilities. Further, it was found that the\\nparticipants experience the digital competence of their peers with\\nlearning disabilities as more useful than that of staff. The often ‐\\nlimited digital competence of persons in the social environment were\\na challenge for the participants, as it often were only one or two\\npersons having the competence to support the performance ofinternet activities.\\nFurther, rules and regulations set up by others were a challenge\\nand interfered with how internet activities were performed. Ruleswere, for example, regulating when to perform internet activities andto what extent. One rule many had, was that other activities had to\\nbe performed before internet activities, such as specific tasks during\\na lesson at school, eating at home, or walking the dog in free time.This was found in all settings, among both staff and parents and for\\nall participants of all ages. This shows that performing internet\\nactivities was often seen by others as a rewarding extra activity,rather than integrated in most everyday activities. Although, it also\\nshows that performing internet activities were highly valued by theparticipants themselves. Further, this indicates that performing\\ninternet activities was something that could be denied by others,revealing that attitudes of staff and parents on internet use can be a\\ncrucial challenge to the performance of internet activities, along with\\nlow digital competence.\\n4.2 |Internet use and social participation\\n4.2.1 |Maintain and establish social contacts\\nAll participants used the internet to communicate and interact with\\nothers which enabled social participation and maintaining social\\ncontacts. Digital communication tools that were picture ‐based, such\\nas FaceTime or Skype, were recurrently used by all, such as Ceciliawho used Skype weekly to keep in contact with her parents and\\nsister. Many participants, but not all, used social media, for example,\\nFacebook, Instagram, Snap Chat, or KiK. The design of social media tobe used asynchronously was pointed out as a possibility when\\ncommunicating with others. For example, Amy, whose father was\\ntravelling in the United States, showed their ongoing short textconversations on Messenger, and pointed out the advantages ofbeing able to have contact without having to phone or keep track of\\ntime zones.\\nA few were chatting in online gaming communities or having\\ngaming apps downloaded and used to communicate and interact with\\nothers. One example is Ella, who plays Yatzy on the smartphone app\\nwith her aunt as a way of keeping in contact. In the follow ‐up\\ninterview with her she was asked:\\nObserver: “So who do you play [Yatzy] with? ”\\nElla: “Eh.…. My mother …. And then …___ ”Observer:\\n“Aaa…. So you play with your mother and she plays on\\nher smartphone? ”Ella: “Yes! Eh …. And Aunt …And aunt\\nwants ……Wants to play …If I do not play, she texts my\\nMum …. and asks …Where is Ella? ”\\nThis shows that playing games using the internet influenced\\nsocial participation, as a way to socialize and interact with someone\\nknown since before and to maintain a social connection. The digital\\ncommunication tools, social media, or gaming apps were mostly usedto keep in touch with friends and family and maintain ongoing\\nrelationships.\\nA few participants were establishing new contacts on social\\nmedia and finding new friends. For example, Lisa was chatting withsomeone on KiK during the first observation occasion. She\\nexplained it was a boy she did not know, who had approached\\nher on Instagram. Now they wrote privately to each other on Kik.This shows that social media is used as an arena to meet new\\npeople and establish social contacts, although the participants\\nmostly used the internet to maintain contact with their existingsocial networks of family members and friends, and less for\\nestablishing new social contacts.ÅGREN ET AL.\\n |129\\n 14683156, 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bld.12519 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [21/07/2023].

       " \"4.2.2 |Belonging to social groups\\nThe digital devices of the participants were influencing social\\nparticipation as they were referred to as artefacts that could\\ndemonstrate special interests shared with others and belonging toa specific group of friends or a public interest group or having a\\nromantic relationship with someone. This was most often done by\\nchoice of pictures appearing on the starting screens that signalledinterests and things one liked, for example, specific car brands,favourite football teams, or pictures of characters in online games\\none played. Many had pictures showing relationships with others for\\nexample private photos of themselves and their pets, familymembers, or oneself on a special event, such as a holiday trip. Only\\na few had a starting screen with a picture of a friend, and one had a\\nphoto of her boyfriend. Some had public photos of film stars and saidit was their boy ‐/girlfriend. Most participants were keen on showing\\nand explaining a lot about their starting screens. Further, the apps\\ndownloaded and appearing on the screen were of importance. Mostwho had social media apps downloaded opened them and showed\\ntheir posts. Many had shared posts with photos from special\\noccasions in everyday life, for example, photos of themselves indresses from the high ‐school dance. Overall, this shows a sense of\\npride and belonging to an adolescent group of young people taking\\npart in social activities for example at school and sharing these\\nexperiences, wanting others to know about them in the same way asmost young people do through devices and on social media today.\\nThis was further highlighted as downloading the same apps as others\\nhad on their starting screens was performed. Molly was observedhaving some dating apps on her smartphone like Tinder. When asked\\nabout them she said she could not show them and continued:\\nMolly: “I don´t know much about them. For dating they\\nare. I just have them here. ”Observer: “OK. Why did you\\ndownload them? ”Molly: “My sister had them. I also\\nwanted to have them. ”\\nThis is an example of having apps that appear on the starting\\nscreen, even though they may not be used. This indicates that havingthe apps was an expression of wanting to belong to a group of young\\npeople who have dating apps on their smartphones and facilitated a\\nsense of social participation.\\n4.2.3 |Restrictions in social participation and social\\ncodes\\nSome participants had experiences of being excluded from online\\ngroups on social media by people they knew and met offline, face toface, such as teachers, staff, or peers. This was described as\\ninfluencing social participation in a restrictive way as participants\\ndescribed feeling sad and insecure when meeting face to face. Forexample, Ella had sent friend requests to teachers at her school on\\nFacebook, but they had declined. After this Ella was reluctant to meetthem at school. But Ella said her Mum had explained to her that they\\nare working together at school, although not being friends. Thisindicates difficulties of understanding the social codes when using\\nthe internet. Another example of this is Shirin, who experienced\\nexclusion from a social group of peers when using social media. Shirinand some friends at school looked at and discussed one of their\\nposted videos from the weekend in a group on Snap Chat and\\nthrough the discussion Shirin understood that she was no longer partof the group on Snap Chat.\\nShirin says: “Can I see? Can I see? ”One of her peers at\\nschool is holding the phone very close to herself saying toShirin: “You´ve seen it already. Don´t go on about it. Did\\nyou know Lili [another peer at school] was erasing you\\nfrom the group [on Snap Chat] this weekend because shefound you so annoying on the film? ”After this, the friend\\nis holding her breath, looking at me, and then back at\\nShirin. Shirin looks down and says: “Oh ok …should I erase\\nher too? ”Her friend says: “No. Remember I erased you,\\nbut I put you back in again ”.\\nThis experience restricted Shirin's social participation, as she\\nhad been excluded from the group of friends in the social media\\napp and this was still talked about the next week at school among\\npeers. Further, Shirin expressed an uncertainty on how to handlethe situation. Both the above examples seemed to serve as a\\nlearning experience of online social codes and behaviour that can\\nbe learnt both with parents and peers. Further, this indicates\\nthat participating in social groups using the internet can be a\\nquickly changing arena of partic ipation, with social codes that\\nmay be difficult to understand for young people with learningdisabilities.\\n4.3 |Internet use and community participation\\n4.3.1 |Searching, finding, and understanding\\ninformation in society\\nSearching for information was performed on the internet by most\\nparticipants using search engines, for example, Google, Bing, andapps like YouTube. Information searched for was of varying sorts, for\\nexample, some looked at the news and read newspapers on the\\ninternet to be updated on local and global happenings. Someonesearched the internet for prices of merchandise. Different apps wereused, for example, to search for information about the weather or for\\ninformation on upcoming TV ‐programs.

Look for it on the internet …Now I can tell my dad …This\\nindicates that he had knowledge, that perhaps his father lacked, tosearch for information on the internet, to be able to get information\\non how to pursue his wish to participate in the community and enrol\\nin further studies.\\n4.3.2 |Using internet to take part in leisure activities\\nin the community\\nInformation to take part in activities in the local community were\\nsearched for online by most participants, for example, aboutmovies at the local cinema or checking opening hours of the local\\nswimming pool or shopping malls. Further, some used social media\\nas a medium to be able to take part in leisure activities. Onee x a m p l eo ft h i si sK y l i ew h os h o w sag r o u pf o ro n l i n ec o m m u n i c a -\\ntion on KiK where every member of her football team is\\nparticipating. In the group, they send messages to decide on carrides to trainings. Kylie says: It is good because I can´t go on the bus\\non my own …If my Dad can't take me I can look here …as my Mum\\ndon't drive …This indicates that using the social media app and\\nbeing a member of the KiK group enabled her to take part in bothtrainings and matches of the footba ll team and facilitated Kylie's\\npossibilities for participation in the community.\\nFurther, participants were searching online for information\\nrelated to feeling more secure to take part in activities in the\\ncommunity. Molly's class was going on a field trip within a week and\\nMolly was hesitant to go. During the break at school, she went to thestationary computer, started Google, and said:\\nMolly: “The Factory of Fun, do you know how it is spelt? “\\nObserver: “I think you have written it the right way there ”\\nMolly: “Ah…OK…You know we are going there and I\\ndon't know …I have never been there ….“She presses\\nPictures in the search engine. ”Oh look, here is the house\\nand different rooms …”. She is clicking on different\\npictures on the homepage. “Oh look here is the park. I\\nthink it is opened …. Yes it is! _ _ _This will be fun ….I\\nthink …. We´ll see …”\\nThis shows that she was searching for the homepage of the\\nplace, as a tool for knowing more about a place she was going, where\\nshe had never been before. She searched for, found, and seemed to\\nunderstand the information and could use it for preparation andbeing less hesitant and decide to take part in the field trip, whichcontributed positively to Molly's possibilities for community\\nparticipation.\\nInternet activities were even performed as a substitute to attend\\nphysically at community activities. For example, when the local\\nfootball team in the highest league played Simon watched the games\\nlive on a streaming channel. Simon explains that he does not want toattend physically, but likes to see the matches and follow the team:It is too loud for me, you know. The game. And there are\\nthe supporters too. Too much to worry about. My earshurt. Here [shows on the device] I can put it down [the\\nvolume] or up ….and I get to see the re ‐runs too ….\\nThis showed an example of how performing internet activities of\\nstreaming live ‐sent services for entertainment enabled taking part in\\na community activity that otherwise Simon would not have takenpart in.\\n4.3.3 |Internet use and restrictions in community\\nparticipation\\nMany were searching for information online to enable participation\\nin activities, but it was challenging for most to find what they were\\nsearching for and even more so, understand it. Some who found\\ninformation on the internet were not able to pursue the activity tocompletion, for example, Marcus, who was checking out the bus\\ntimetables to travel to and from a friend on the local bus. He took a\\nbus to his friend but did not understand the information on theinternet correctly to be able to take the bus back home and said hehad to phone his dad to get picked up. This led to experiences of\\nrestrictions in community particip ation. This was also the experi-\\nence of Kylie, who had ordered cinema tickets online, but whenshe got to the local cinema, she could not get the tickets out of the\\nmachine. She explained that she had phoned her dad who tried to\\nhelp her but that she and her friend didn't figure it out and did notmake it to the cinema in time. These examples indicates that\\nparticipants' learning disabilities limited the possibilities to under-\\nstand community information and gave limited possibilities forexercising citizenship.\\nBanking business was an activity hard to pursue for most and\\nMarcus explained that he had difficulties to get an idea of the amount\\nof money on his bank account:\\nIt now costs money to get a paper out from the bank. As I\\ndon't have an internet bank .I may get it soon; my dad\\nwill try. But he doesn't know if it will work for me …\\nThis indicates that performing the everyday activity of knowing\\nthe amount of money one had without using the internet meant an\\nincrease in costs compared to using the internet. However, it also\\nshows that performing the banking business using the internet maynot even be possible for this young man. These communityparticipation restrictions showed obvious limitations when using\\nthe internet and was hindering participation in going to the cinema,\\nusing public transportation, and performing banking businesses.Further, these activities were described by participants has having\\nbecome more difficult in today's digitalized society and this reveals\\nexamples of restrictions in exercising citizenship and managing dailylife due to internet use.ÅGREN ET AL.\\n |131\\n 14683156, 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bld.12519 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [21/07/2023].

       " \"5|DISCUSSION\\nThis study set out with the aim to explore and describe environ-\\nmental opportunities and challenges when performing internet\\nactivities and how internet use influences social and communityparticipation for young people with learning disabilities from their\\nown perspectives. The findings show that all participants performed\\ninternet activities that influenced social participation by communi-cating and interacting online with others, although not all used socialmedia. Yet, more examples of internet use influencing social\\nparticipation were found than examples of community participation,\\nmeanwhile, restrictions were found within both. This supports theneed to expand the research focus toward internet outcomes as\\ndeterminants of digital divides as proposed by Scheerder et al. ( 2017 )\\nalso for people with learning disabilities. The examples of internet useinfluencing social participation, interacting with others, mostly to\\nmaintain and occasionally establish new relations, show that the\\ninternet is used in similar ways as among young people in general andthat young people with learning disabilities now belong to the digital\\ngeneration (Borgström et al., 2019 ). Further, the finding of perform-\\ning internet activities relating to posting on social media andbelonging to social groups are in line with previous research onidentification processes supported by internet use for young people\\nwith learning disabilities (Molin et al., 2017 ). However, restrictions\\nwere found in difficulty to understand social online codes, ashas previously been reported (Caton & Chapman, 2016 ; Lussier ‐\\nDesrochers et al., 2017 ).\\nFewer examples of internet use that enabled participation in\\ncommunity were found, although examples of using internet to feel\\nmore secure to take part in events in community or streaming the\\nfootball matches of the favourite team were found. The latterenabled taking part in the activity without being physically presentat the arena, but rather in the safe place of home. This possibility of\\nbeing active online at home has been suggested to contribute to\\nenhanced feelings of being active in society (Spassiani et al., 2022 ).\\nThis shows that internet use made it possible to take part in\\ncommunity activities exercising citizenship on equal terms as others\\nin line with acts and laws (SFS, 1993 : 387; UN, 2006 ). However, the\\ndigitalization of society in the community and at the global level\\nwere identified in our study as influencing the performance of\\ninternet activities in a restrictive way often with difficulties on howto proceed to complete an activity. In line with this the knowledge in\\nour study points out that most offline possibilities related to\\ncommunity participation have been removed from society forexample the possibility to buy cinema tickets at the cinema, bust i c k e t so nt h eb u so rv i s i tt h eb a n kf o rb a n k i n gb u s i n e s s e sw i t h o u t\\nan extra cost added. Replacing these services with only online\\nservices is an environmental challenge for people with learningdisabilities that obstruct community participation. Our study can be\\nregarded as a contribution to this research area, though further\\nstudies are warranted in this unexplored field of how to translateinternet use into offline possibilities for people with learning\\ndisabilities (Glencross et al., 2021 ).An unexpected finding in our study was the preference of the\\nparticipants to get digital support from their peers with learningdisabilities rather than from staff. Similar findings of participants\\nturning to younger people when they needed technical support has\\nbeen reported (Molin et al., 2017 ). However, it has not been found in\\nstudies including young people with moderate learning disabilities, to\\nour knowledge. The result from our present study indicates that the\\ndigital competence among staff and older people, for example,parents, is viewed upon as insufficient among young people withlearning disabilities and are in line with Molin et al. ( 2017 ). Further, it\\nwas found in our study that support persons often managed to create\\na concrete and suitable learning situation for the young person withlearning disabilities when using the internet for social participation,\\nfor example explaining about social codes on the internet. This was\\noccurring both together with parents and peers, with the latter beingin line with earlier studies that reported on people with learning\\ndisabilities turning to their peers when encountering difficulties with\\ncomments on social media (Kim & Qian, 2021 ; Molin et al., 2017 ).\\nThis type of concrete learning situation was not found when using\\nthe internet related to community participation. Those situations\\ncould rather be characterized as abstract and with a lack of socialsupport, for example, having to find out about further studies oneself.This shows that there are different conditions regarding the type of\\nlearning situations for social and community participation. This\\nhighlights that using the internet and its outcomes to participate intoday's digitalized society is more challenging among people with\\nlearning disabilities than performing internet activities for social\\nparticipation, as has been previously reported by parents of youngpeople with learning disabilities (Sorbring et al., 2017 ). Our result\\nimplies that the proposed shift referred to of young people living\\ntheir everyday life through the internet (Livingstone et al., 2018 )i s\\nstill not reached for young people with a learning disability. However,the performance of internet activities related to social participation\\nmay be a starting point to elaborate and make use of internet for\\ncommunity participation to a greater extent for young people withlearning disabilities. Similar findings indicate that with support to\\nenhance one's digital skills to use the internet possibilities beyond\\nsocial connectedness may be offered (Barlott et al., 2020 ).\\nFurther, the findings in this study on environmental opportunities\\nand challenges show that these often go hand in hand and are\\nintertwined for people with learning disabilities using the internet.The challenges of understanding the social online environment with\\nnew social codes to learn may contribute to restrictions in social\\nparticipation. Solutions, for example, individualized support forlearning, has been recommended, but not tested (Lussier ‐\\nDesrochers et al., 2017 ). People in the social environment providing\\ndigital support may challenge or create opportunities for using the\\ninternet. Their attitudes toward internet use and digital competencehave been reported as a possibility to both lower and increase the\\nbarriers to internet use in general for people with learning disabilities\\n(Sorbring et al., 2017 ). When it comes to the physical and digital\\nenvironment, participants often used more than one digital device\\nwhich has been highlighted previously to promote social participation132 |\\nÅGREN ET AL.\\n 14683156, 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bld.12519 by CochraneItalia, Wiley Online Library on [21/07/2023].

       " \"through internet use among people with learning disabilities (Martin\\net al., 2021 ). However, the finding also reveals accessibility\\nchallenges regarding the design of devices, apps, and websites where\\nactions in several steps needs to be taken, which are in line with\\nearlier studies (Barlott et al., 2021; Darcy et al., 2016 ). These findings\\nneed to be communicated to digital product and web ‐designers,\\ntogether with a call for using principles of universal design for all, that\\nis, that products, or services in a specific environment should bedesigned to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it (Centrefor Excellence in Universal design, 2022 ). This is emphasized in the\\nCRPD (UN, 2006 ) as a strategy for a society being inclusive of all.\\n5.1 |Methodological considerations\\nThe aim was reached through the study design of observations in the\\nparticipants everyday settings and the use of cognitively adapted\\nfollow ‐up interviews to ensure the perspective of the target group.\\nThe data collection design was vigorous but relevant to get access to\\nthe participants perspectives. All participants in this study were\\ninternet users and the findings are not transferable to the generalpopulation of people with learning disabilities. The findings indicatemore situations of internet outcomes when performing internet\\nactivities influencing social participation, rather than community\\nparticipation. This could be a circumstance depending on the youngage of the participants with a mean age of 18.5 years and a range\\nfrom 13 to 24. Activities in the community related to being an adult\\nfor example handling banking business, may not have beenappropriate everyday life activities for all participants. There is a\\nneed to further explore aspects of community participation related to\\nperforming internet activities in future research, and include youngadults with learning disabilities, from the age of 18 and above.\\n6|CONCLUSION\\nThe research reveals this group of young people with learning\\ndisabilities as active internet users that highly valued performinginternet activities and were motivated to use the internet as has been\\nfound previously (Chadwick, 2022 ). They were performing internet\\nactivities on their own and together with others and preferred digitalsupport from peers rather than support from family or staff. More\\nexamples of internet use positively influencing social participation\\nwere found, contrary to community participation. These findingsdemonstrate the relevance of a distinction within the concept ofparticipation as described by Chang and Coster ( 2014 ), who separate\\nbetween social and community participation. Further, the results\\nindicate that concrete learning situations in combination with socialsupport when using internet for social participation were adapted to\\nthe participants and promoted this type of participation. Community\\nparticipation situations can be described as the opposite andrestricted opportunities to participate in society. Due to this,\\nconcrete learning situations including social digital competentsupport are recommended for different types of internet use for\\ninfluencing social and in particular community participation.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nThis research was supported by internal funding from the Faculty ofMedicine and Health Sciences, Linköping University, Sweden.\\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\\nThe authors report no conflicts of interest.\\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\\nResearch data are not shared.\\nORCID\\nKristin Alfredsson Ågren\\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0002-6413-584X\\nREFERENCES\\nAlfredsson Ågren, K., Kjellberg, A., & Hemmingsson, H.
