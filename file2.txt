Abstract

Background: A digital

lag has been reported on access to the internet and

performing internet activities for young people with learning disabilities in

everyday life.

Aim: The aim of this study is to explore environmental opportunities and challenges

when performing internet activities and how internet use influences social and

community participation for young people with learning disabilities from the

perspectives of the target group.
Methods: An inductive design was applied, with focused observations and follow‐up
interviews of 15 internet‐using young persons with learning disabilities in their

everyday settings. The data was analysed interpretatively using open coding.

Findings: The environment offered both opportunities and challenges in terms of the

design of digital devices and digital support. Support from peers was often preferred.

All participants performed internet activities related to social participation although

not all used social media. Searching for information was performed, however, finding

the information or understanding it was challenging and led to restricted

participation in the community.

Conclusion: More examples of internet use positively influencing social participation

were found, contrary to community participation.

It is indicated that concrete

learning situations when using the internet for social participation were more

adapted to the participants and promoted this type of participation, contrary to

situations of internet use influencing community participation.

• We observed and interviewed people in their everyday settings of school or

activity service and home about their internet use.

• Young people prefer digital support from peers rather than staff when using the

internet.

• People do internet activities to have contact with others, but it was a challenge to

find and understand information online and to take part in activities in the

community.

This study aims to explore environmental opportunities and

challenges when performing internet activities and how internet

use influences social and community participation for young people

with learning disabilities from the perspectives of the target group.

The focus of the data collection was on the internet devices

including apps and the internet activities the participants performed

in their everyday life, and the settings they performed them in. Data
were collected through participant observations in two‐three every-

day settings per participant being at school or activity services and at
home. A follow‐up interview was done with each participant at the

last observation. To get access to the target groups perspective

cognitive adaptations were made to enable the participant's view.
Photographs were taken during the observations and used as picture‐
based support during the follow‐up interviews

(Folkestad &

Folkestad, 2000). Further, the questions asked during observations
and the follow‐up interviews were formulated with easier wordings
or in either‐or format (Taylor et al., 2016). All data collection was

performed by the first author.

The aim was reached through the study design of observations in the

participants everyday settings and the use of cognitively adapted
follow‐up interviews to ensure the perspective of the target group.

The data collection design was vigorous but relevant to get access to

the participants perspectives. All participants in this study were

internet users and the findings are not transferable to the general

population of people with learning disabilities. The findings indicate

The research reveals this group of young people with learning

disabilities as active internet users that highly valued performing

internet activities and were motivated to use the internet as has been

found previously (Chadwick, 2022). They were performing internet

activities on their own and together with others and preferred digital

support from peers rather than support from family or staff. More

examples of internet use positively influencing social participation

were found, contrary to community participation. These findings

demonstrate the relevance of a distinction within the concept of

participation as described by Chang and Coster (2014), who separate

between social and community participation. Further, the results

indicate that concrete learning situations in combination with social

support when using internet for social participation were adapted to

the participants and promoted this type of participation. Community

participation situations can be described as the opposite and

restricted opportunities to participate in society. Due to this,
